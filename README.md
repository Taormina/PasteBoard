# What is this?
This is a utility for letting me have access to things from my computer's clipboard on my phone.
With Dropbox, you can use 'pbpaste > ~/Dropbox/pastedump.txt' to push the contents of your clipboard
to your PasteBoard app. **You'll need to provide the app the Dropbox link of the file you want to use.**
You can either set that in-app or set it in res/strings.xml. Debug builds can reset to the string in
res/strings.xml if needed.
